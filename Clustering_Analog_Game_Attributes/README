## General Info
This project explores the composition of groupings for board game attributes and the group relationships to subjective ratings for board games.  
A k-means clustering algorithm is used to identify clusters of games with similar attributes.

## Data
The dataset for this project consists of user ratings and attributes for board games that are listed on the boardgamegeek website.  
Attributes found in the data include the number of players, recommended minimum age for a player, and the expected game duration.  
Additional attributes include the publisher, designer, and artist as well as date of first publishing, game mechanics and general categories that describe the game.  
The dataset is rich, containing over 100,000 cases with data collected over two decades since the website was launched.

## Setup
