## General Info
This project explores heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in the United States, and how a machine learning classification algorithm can be effectively applied to healthcare data.  
Electrocardiogram data collected across four different geographic locations is used to determine if explanatory metrics collected from this test can accurately predict if a patient has heart disease.  
An ensemble learning methodology is utilized to minimize error for this critical subject and improve model accuracy.  
The results of this project could be used to assist in early detection of heart disease to allow healthcare workers to administer applicable medication and advice.
