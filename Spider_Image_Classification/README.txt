## General Info
Among the many different species of spiders in Nebraska, there are two spiders whose venom is dangerous to humans: 
the brown recluse (Loxosceles reclusa) and the black widow (Latrodectus).Â  
The goal of this project is to develop a pre-trained image classification network to help people identify whether a spider that they find, 
whether it be in their home, yard, or anywhere else in Nebraska, should be avoided.
