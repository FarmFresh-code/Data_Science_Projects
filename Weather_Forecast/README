## General Info
This Python project interacts with the user to obtain specifications for which it provides a weather forecast.
The program asks the user if they would like to enter either a zip code or city location to get a weather conditions for that location.
The program determines if a zipcode or city name will be entered by the user, then validates the user entry.  
The program uses a GET request to obtain the forecast for the location from the server. The server returns json data containing several weather forecast variables.  
The program parses the data, stores only the required weather data in a response.json() variable, and prints the forecast data to the user.  
The program prompts the user for another forecast and implements error checking with a sentinel value for their response.


## Data
The data is obtained from the openweathermap website via an API key and a GET request.
Data in json format is retrieved and processed before being displayed to the user.
